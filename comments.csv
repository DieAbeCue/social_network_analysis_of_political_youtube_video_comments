"@Lori Killion Because it was. Coloured slaves played a significant role in helping the development of the USA (1, 2). And those countries had colonies which they exploited the local population into gathering the land's resources to enrich themselves. It isn't just slavery but rather this includes all the racist policies and acts that befell the African population in the whole of the USA. And just because they are no longer in effect does not mean the consequences of these acts are not present. Take redlining for instance where African Americans were denied federal home loans, which allowed white families to increase their wealth while leaving Blacks behind in poverty. Even after these policies were removed blacks found themselves being unable to purchase property¬†as they didn't have the finance to purchase them (3). And the reason many of these women have so children¬†is due to a lack of sex education which is the result of poverty.

And I see you're using the Asians as the Perfect Minority example despite them only representing a few groups while ignoring those that are impoverished. Not only that but this ignores the fact that people who make up this ""ideal"" group originated from high-skill migrant families that came after these racist policies were removed. And yet whenever people try to help empower minorities you cry foul about how whites are being discriminated against despite the fact that these groups have faced constant discrimination from whites.

There should be. By increasing representation, you are given those marginalised a voice which allows their issues to be heard and focused on. In the long term, it helps improves the standard of their¬†living conditions. What you are doing is pushing the blame of their current condition on themselves rather than acknowledge the consequences of historical acts of oppression.

"""Study after study proves that guns deter crime..."" Care to give citations to these studies? I am only aware of a handful of such studies and the studies of Klepp have been critized for serious flaws. E.g. that the CDC is not allowed by law to collect any statistics on gun violence, so actually there is no hard data for gun deaths and gun related injuries, suicides etc. So Klepp did an opinion poll of gun owners to get at least some data. Opinion polls do not count as ""studies"" in the scientific sense if they do not control e.g. for false or boasting answers. This is where the 2,5 million prevented crimes number comes from: ""homeowner reported that he prevented 5 crimes last year"". The problem is that no police report might be filed if the gun is not fired and no blood is shed. So there is also no hard data on ""prevented crimes"" that would hold up to scientific scrutiny. Do not label deeply flawed studies conducted by mostly the same researchers, who are paid by weapon manufacturer lobbyists, as scientific consensus. That is just bad science reporting.",11,GC,2,0

"It‚Äôs just like... the real problem is unequal  education based on the way public education is funded. I think that should be fixed and then once a better base system is in placed we could move on from affirmative action policies.

As an African American raised in a high crime City on the east coast, my school system was just not good because of my neighborhood has lower revenue from tax payers...the school a few miles a way over a made up county boundary had a stronger tax base, so more funding , better teachers and resources and taught a better curriculum. It‚Äôs not fair to children, many are smart but just born to parents that live in a different (the wrong)  county. I feel like that‚Äôs a lot of peoples‚Äô scenario. 

Personal perspective:
I luckily made it into college and through an engineering program to get my degree, but struggled constantly  and felt discouraged because my peers from other school districts had a stronger base of education. I had to try to excel in the curriculum while just trying to catch up to the base of knowledge. Many of the other black students were also from bad off school systems couldn‚Äôt be extra ordinary overcome this dynamic and either fail out or switch to less demanding majors that may not provide high paying careers.",3,AA,1,1

"@Generic snacks It is a sort of punishment when another employee who is less qualified or isn't as knowledgeable gets a raise while the other does not. It devalues earning your place through merit. Affirmative action does harm white people and Asian Americans because it devalues the education that they have received. Affirmative action doesn't even help African American or minority communities in the long run either because they will be under prepared for the collegiate level if K-12 education is lacking - which it is. It also does not help African Americans and minorities who do not go to college. They will never receive a decent education unless these systems are fixed. Affirmative action doesn't even attempt to help all minority populations. Just because affirmative action is an easier solution doesn't mean it is the right solution. It isn't. The right solution is fixing the the part of the system where the problem originates from - K-12 education. 

And it is possible to lift everybody up at the same time by making college admissions based on merit and socioeconomic need. If everyone is able to have access to the same K-12 opportunities, then it will be a level playing field. Affirmative action is a perfect example of promoting equality of outcome rather than equality of opportunity. I will admit, opportunity, especially for poorer African American communities isn't in a great place, but to fix it, change the education system in these communities instead.",4,AA,0,1

"David, I am pro-choice and I agree with you. Most people don't know that abortions past 12 weeks is incredibly rare. less than 1%.

I think the only thing that should be an exception past that mark is medical anomalies of the fetus or risk of health to the mother. 
I was reading about this woman who had a wanted pregnancy, but got a 3rd trimester (remember incredibly rare) abortion because her baby's brain was not developing.  the development of the brain happens in the 3rd trimester, they wouldn't have seen the abnormality earlier,  her baby would have been born without a brian, and died not long after birth.",13,AL,0,1

"Trashing Affirmative Action, vilifying its stated objectives misrepresents what it was attempting to address--blatant racism & discrimination in the hiring practices of industry & the admissions policies of colleges & universities. Affirmative Action in its implementation was never a quota system as the ill-informed would have us believe. It simply required that women & people of color be included as part of the pool being considered for hiring or admission. That was it, nothing more. Only under the most egregious policies would government step in to insist that a temporary quota system be implemented & only for a short time. I grew up in a low-income neighborhood with serious social ills (barrio) where some 87% of population were Latinos & about 12% Blacks & maybe 1% White. The most stable, lucrative jobs in my community tended to be in the public sector, i.e., teachers, police officers & fire men, janitors maintaining the housing authority or local primary schools. Almost all of these jobs were populated by White outsiders that had little connection to the residents. The skilled jobs were overwhelmingly White & the unskilled work that paid miserable wages were Latino. Cross the tracks, outside the barrio, homes were nicely kept & it was overtly obvious that the system was setup to privilege one group over the other. Anyone that lives in the rural areas of California where Fresno's Devin Nunez & Bakersfield's Kevin McCarthy live, quickly come to understand one's place in the political arena--Latinos are not to be heard or acknowledged in spite of their growing numbers. The tragedy that afflicts many young people that grow up in poverty is the fact that many of them are talented, intelligent, capable of competing if the system worked to include them. Whites do not have a monopoly on ability, no matter what some racists might think. & as some so correctly have stated on this board, it has been White women that have benefitted the most from Affirmative Action not poor people of color. I don't want the pity of White liberals or the hate of some White conservatives. Just give people a fighting chance, show the same love & attention that is given to privileged White kids to the less fortunate White, Black, Brown & Yellow kids that come from low-income households so they can also contribute positively to society.",3,AA,1,1

"@Bob The second Amendment isn‚Äôt the only thing in the constitution that limits power, it is just the final check and balance.  There are currently around 1.4 million military troops in the US Military.  If you do the math with your figures there are 98.4 million armed citizens in the US.  Now they aren‚Äôt a United Army buy any means (thank goodness).  However if a president that controls the military almost exclusively were to try and over throw our democracy, I imagine that would unify many of them fairly quickly.  That is the final check.  It helps to ensure that any President would at the vary least only have a burnt cinder to rule over if they managed to use the military to take total control of the government.  

As far as the dictators that I listed.  They all started out as elected presidents.  They all used there power to gain total control of the army.  They all at some point tried to disarm the majority of there population under the guise  of defending the government and protecting the people.  

Absolute power Corrupts Absolutely.  The want for power is the one thing that Democrats and Republicans have in common.  The only way us peasants survive is buy insuring neither party becomes so powerful as to completely overtake the other.  The final line of defense is to ensure that if one party or president were to gain so much power that they would begin to do away with many of the checks and balances our government has in place, against the will of large amounts of the citizens who are reasonably armed.  The hope is that the consequences would be so catastrophic as to prevent even an attempt.  For 244 years now that deterrent has worked with only one total civil war in the middle.  That ultimately is a pretty good record, comparatively.   

All the rights we enjoy as American Citizens come with consequences.  I wouldn‚Äôt be so eager to give them up if I was you.  The cost of buying them back is historically extremely costly, and I for one would prefer to never have to see my fellow citizens nor myself have to pay the price of buying them back.  

So why don‚Äôt we just keep are constitutional rights.  

Personally I think the best amendment are the ones that give more citizens rights, like the 13th the 15th and the 19th.  I know the 18th amendment didn‚Äôt go over very well and we got our rights back later under the 21st amendment, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the norm.  Usually when you loose a right it is gone for a long time and costly to get back.  Don‚Äôt wish them away so easily.ü§óüá∫üá∏",6,GC,0,2

"I wonder if it's more a love affair with Americans' deluded sense of ""individual freedom"" and  exceptionalism. It's not accurate to say that guns are the reason that the country is unsafe. The 2nd amendment was around long before I was born, and I remember a time when mass shootings were not dominating the news. I was already out of high school (thank God) when the Columbine massacre took place. That was a game changer, and I saw the narrative change after that. Luckily, I left the States and moved to Australia (where guns had become extremely restricted in the not too distant past) for university. John Howard was the prime minister. Australians had been divided over his policy on guns, but by the time I arrived there, the majority of people saw it as a necessary change. They could not comprehend the US attitude toward guns. After graduating from university, I lived and worked in 4 other countries outside the US and Australia. 

I also taught international students in California for a period of time, many of whom had come from Brazil to study medical English. Those students explained that Brazilian cities were overcome by crime and that there were many guns in the hands of gangs, leaving ordinary citizens with no means of helping themselves. I've heard similar stories from El Salvadorian refugees in CA. Both groups used to talk about how obsessed Americans seemed to be with their individual ""right to defend"" their wealth and property from hypothetical criminals intent on stealing from them. They also talked about how obsessed Americans seemed to be with the idea of being American and having the ""right to bear arms"" because of their nationality. 

The Brazilian and El Salvadorians (those I met) did not think that the US should ban guns. They just could not understand why Americans' were so fixated on their ""right"" to have them and their ""right"" to shoot somebody. 

I live in Germany now, by God's grace.. It's not perfect. There have been 3 shootings in the news since I've moved here. It happens. It is not sensationalised or politicised in the media. The society here is generally more intellectually sound and mature than American society ever was when I lived there. They're not obsessed with being German. They're not deluded by a false sense of exceptionalism. They've been down that road and learned from their mistakes. They live with the repercussions of their former ideology and accept that every subsequent generation will have to bear that burden as well. ¬†

Germany is one of five countries I've had the privilege of living in where the fear of being shot (or shot at) is not really on my mind. I also don't fear the society here, even when I see lawlessness. I cannot say the same of the States. They are too far gone there. Years of nationalist indoctrination and exceptionalism coupled with unchecked corporatisation, and now the extremist-driven polarisation in their politics and media, have sunk the Deluded States of America.

"Charlie's talking to his friends and says ""Hey, you know Mike was shot just around the corner because someone thought he was a gang member when we're just part of a community organisation!?""
Wendy said ""Omg, really? That's insane. Was anything done about?""
Charlie looked at her, with sadness in his eyes and replied, ""No, there wasn't even a discussion about it, beyond the police saying, he MUST have been a gang member or this never would have happened.""
Charlie, now sitting, his head in his hands looks at Peter, who so far hasn't said anything and is just staring off into the distance, but looks dismayed. Finally Peter says, ""Is there anything we can do to prevent this from happening?""
Charlie replies, ""No, it's everyone's 2nd Amendment right to own guns. So everyone you meet is possibly carrying a weapon!"". He starts to stand up when a foreigner walks over.
""Hey, I'm Eric, is there nothing you can do? Protest to change the laws?"" interrupting everyone who was there.
""Absolutely not! It is a God given right for us to carry weapons!!!"" Chris shouts. Another of Charlie's friends.
""Where does it say that in the Bible?"" Eric asks politely, feeling the tension in the air.
""Oh, it's not the Bible, it's in our Bill of rights!? Charlie retorts, almost sarcastically. As he was thinking, Eric must be an idiot.
Eric looks down for a second, noticing that there are several blood stains on the sidewalk, after a short time he asks ""So this was stated on the foundation of your Country? In the original Bill of Rights? There's absolutely no way to make any changes?""
Almost in unison, the group says, somewhat aggressively at this point ""You can't make changes to the Bill of Rights! It's our second amendment right to own and bare arms!""
""Oh, so at some point, the Bill of Rights 'was' amended?"" trying to sound as friendly as possible, ""So there can be changes made?""
At this point, Lucas pulled out his 9mm semi-automatic pistol saying ""No one has the right to take away our 2nd amendment rights!"" now waving the pistol in the air, ""This here, this is what keeps me safe at night and no one can change that! No one has the authority!"" as a shot rang out in the distance and Lucas fell to the floor. Lucy scrambled, moving for the first time since they had arrived, leaping to Lucas' aid. Trying to stem the flow of blood now flowing from the artery in Lucas' neck.
She looks up at the group and says ""What on Earth just happened?"" when a passer-by shouts ""Everyone on the ground right now!!!"" The group complies.
Eric looks at Charlie and says ""Look, the amendment was made in the Supreme Court, right?"" terrified, but still following the same train of thought, ""Couldn't this be taken to the Supreme Court and amended again? Obviously, if the Bill of Rights has been changed once, it can updated again?""

"I'm still thinking about how reserving a certain amount of places for low income and low opportunity people/places would remedy this injustice in a way that would feel fair to most people. If we take redlining this has resulted in less wealth accumulation and with the funding system for schools results in low opportunity and less effective teaching. As such these students are less formed than their peers in more affluent neighbourhoods. These places being a high  amount of POC means that they will benefit the most (and as such addressing injustice) but doing it this way will over time transfer from a mostly POC population into the normal distribution between people. And as such the giving of opportunity to less well off people is helping society grow en be better while also providing a way for people to get themselves in better positions.
